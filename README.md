**So easy your human companion could do it too!**

Python is a programming language which are instructions for computers on how to do things. Just the same as one controls humans with giant pleading eyes or incessant whining, one controls computers with statements written in a programming language. It is easy to get started with Python so you can have computers do crazy things!

Python started as a simple and readable programming language for various applications. Nowadays, Python runs in more places than just computers—it powers web servers, data science, artificial intelligence, and even robots! This page will teach you some Python basics so that you can get up and coding in no time*.

_* Actual time: more than none. Probably an hour or two. Also, since you are a dog, you may get distracted by squirrels along the way._

## Don't tuck in your tail

You'll always find your way—even when programming! Unlike knocking over a bowl of water with your tail, nothing in these tutorials will harm your computer, even if you mistype a command or press the wrong key. Like dogs, programmers make mistakes all the time: forgetting commands, missing colons, or getting distracted by something shiny (or, in your case, a tennis ball). Programmers care more about making it work eventually rather than trying to make it work the very first time. The key to learning is persistence—just like how you keep trying to catch your tail!

So don't tuck in your tail and run away! The worst thing that can happen is that you might have to restart your program if you get stuck. But don't worry, that’s just part of the fun!

## The basics

There is Python running all over the web. Let's play around with it a little. For the sake of simplicity, we will skip the steps on installing it on your computer and use an online IDE like PythonAnywhere to follow along (if you aren't, it’s probably easiest for both of us if you sign up for a free account there). 

An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which is a special app that helps you write, test, and fix code more easily by putting everything you need—like a text editor, a way to run your code, and debugging tools—all in one place. In this case, PythonAnywhere allows you to work with Python anywhere.

First, log in to PythonAnywhere and open a new console by pressing the Python button (any version of Python listed will do). You should see something that looks like this:

`[NEED IMG]`

This is a Python console, otherwise known as an interactive shell or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It is basically a way to type one command at a time and immediately see Python's response. It’s an incredibly useful learning tool (I still use the interactive shell nearly every day when coding).

The Python console does some pretty cool stuff. Try typing 1 + 1 and then hitting the Enter key and watch what happens. The console is a great place to test things out when you’re unsure how something works. If you're ever stuck, just experiment in the console and figure it out! Here’s an example:
